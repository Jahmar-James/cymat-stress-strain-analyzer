# Architecture Document

This document outlines the current high-level design of the application. As the project evolves, this document will be updated to include more details.

## Current High-Level Architecture

1. **Core Logic (Policy Layer)**: Contains the main business rules and behaviors (e.g., test setup, data cleaning, visualization logic).
2. **Details Layer**: Handles external integrations (e.g., database, plotting libraries, reporting tools).
3. **User Interface (UI)**: Manages user interactions via a simple graphical interface.
4. **Reporting Module**: Exports results and visualizations into reports (e.g., Word, Excel).

## Notes for Future Enhancements

- Define interactions between the core policy layer and external tools.
- Plan for modularization of key components to simplify maintenance and scalability.
- Document decisions about the technology stack as they become finalized.
