## Python Import and Package Management Best Practices

### Introduction

This section outlines the best practices for managing imports and dependencies within this project. Adhering to these guidelines will help prevent issues like circular imports and make the code more maintainable and readable.

### Guidelines

#### 1. Forward Declarations

Use forward declarations to reference types in function signatures and class bodies that will be defined later in the code. This can help in avoiding circular dependencies.

**Bad Practice:**

```python
from my_module import MyClass

def my_function(arg: MyClass):
    pass
```

**Good Practice:**

```python
from __future__ import annotations

def my_function(arg: 'MyClass'):
    pass
```

#### 2. Limit "from x import y" Style Imports

Import only what you need. Do not import the entire module unless it's necessary.

**Bad Practice:**

```python
from os import *
```

**Good Practice:**

```python
from os import path, remove
```

#### 3. Use Relative Imports

Prefer relative imports when importing modules within the same package. This enhances code portability and readability.

**Example:**

In a file `data_layer/models/specimen.py`, import another module within `data_layer` as follows:

```python
from ..metrics import specimen_metrics
```

#### 4. Use Python Interfaces or Abstract Classes

Utilize Python's built-in abstract classes to create interfaces. This enables more explicit contracts between different parts of your application and avoids circular dependencies.

**Example:**

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class IAnalyzable(ABC):
    
    @abstractmethod
    def analyze(self):
        pass
```

#### 5. Decouple Using Callbacks

Use callback mechanisms to decouple different parts of the system and avoid circular dependencies.

**Example:**

```python
class Specimen:
    def __init__(self, callback=None):
        self.callback = callback

    def analyze(self):
        if self.callback:
            self.callback(self)
```

### Conclusion

Following these guidelines will ensure that the project maintains a high level of code quality and is easy to manage and extend in the future. Always remember, code is read more often than it is written; make it readable, extendable, and maintainable.
